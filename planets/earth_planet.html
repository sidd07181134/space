        <h2>Planet Information</h2>
        <p>This planet is nothing but ruins of what once was. Dilapidated buildings cover the planet's surface as nature has taken over. Any inspection of the buildings shows that this planet has been picked clean. Anything worth taking has either been taken by treasure hunters or governments.</p>
