        <h2>Planet Information</h2>
        <p>Red Planet is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. It is named after the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>
